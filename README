    4. Tech Stack:
            React Native - cross Platform of javascript to develop mobile app
            Expo
            Reason:
                - Because react-native is the most popular framework to develop mobile nowadays so I want to try to use it.
                - I want to enhance my FE skills so I  want to practice javascript to easily approach other FE framwork such as Next.js or React
            The advantage of React-native: 
                - You can test in both Iphone and android
                - Use javscript which is easy to read than Java (I think )
                - easy to build UI because I use CSS and the same as swift UI
            The DrawBack:
                - I do not get familiar with JS so it takes me a lot of time to research so my app will have some bugs(I try my best to fix all the bug ms)
                - Because of I'm familiar with React-native so the structure of the my code is quite bad so it is really hard to debug
                - Some feature is quite hard to implement such as download, the doc is quite hard to read and understand. Sometimes the version of the lib is not up to date to the modern react native so it causes many conflicts.
